          Heat the milk in a saucepan without bringing it to a boil. Add sugar
          and cocoa powder.

        <li>At the same time, prepare a water bath. Melt the butter on it.</li>
        <li>
          "Mix" the milk mixture and already liquid butter. Mix thoroughly with
          a silicone spatula so that the mass becomes uniform and silky.

        <li>Heat the mixture over low heat, letting it barely boil.</li>
        <li>
          Pour the chocolate into special containers (can be replaced with ice
